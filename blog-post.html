                  <p>It’s no surprise that early-stage boards aren’t as diverse as they could be, but we were surprised to see that 
                    today, only ⅓ of companies have independent directors. Today, 85% of directors on Foundry direct portfolio 
                    company boards are White, and 57% of our companies currently have open board seats. As such, there is a real 
                    opportunity to build a more diverse pipeline of independent director candidates for our founders and CEOs.
                  </p>
                  <p> We believe that increasing diversity at the most senior levels is a critical business objective, and this 
                    starts with measuring where you stand today. That’s why Foundry partnered with Bolster in this important 
                    research and as a talent partner, and had over 50 Foundry portfolio company CEOs and 10 partner funds 
                    participate in this study.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Section Title</h3>
                  <p>Today, the Foundry Network spans 38 VC firms (our ‘Partner Funds’) and 1500+ companies 
                    (this doesn’t include the 2,000+ companies that have graduated from a Techstars Accelerator Program). 
                    Think about it: If half of those companies also have open board roles, that means our firm has direct 
                    or indirect influence into more than 750 open board seats.
